Task : 64x64 images - binary classification
Description of architecture, VGG Networks or can try other networks too

TODO:
Plot the training, validation and test error
Record the final training, valid and test performance

Compare hyperparameter settings and report final results 
of performance on test set

Include analysis :
Visualizing feature maps
Visualizing kernels
Examples where images are clearly misclassified
Case where classifier predicts around 50% 

Explain the suggestions and improvements that can possibly be made


Things to try :
- Different network architectures
- Try different optimizers (4 different used) (Done)
- Early Stopping or not (Done)
 
- Try different feature normalization (Batch Norm, Without Batch Norm,) (Done)
- Regularizers (Done)

- Auto saving of results (Done)
